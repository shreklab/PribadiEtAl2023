The code in this repository relates to the following manuscript:
"Dopamine signaling regulates predator-driven changes in Caenorhabditis elegansâ€™ egg laying behavior"
Amy Pribadi, Michael A Rieger, Kaila Rosales, Kirthi C Reddy, Sreekanth H Chalasani

Note: The final figure numbering/lettering scheme has changed for the final submission
Because changing all the code would have been laborious, code has been kept intact but please use the key at the bottom for figure/code correspondencies

Dependencies:


R analyses depend on the car and multcomp packages for omnibus and post hoc comparisons.
Additionally the readxl package is used to read Excel data files.

The original data spreadsheet and planned post hoc comparisons sheets used by this code are included for reproducibility, but the code for each set of analyses has a preamble section where these sheets are defined and this can be modified as desired.


Root directory:

alwaysLoad.R : Includes a number of wrapper functions for preparing code outputs as well as initialization options and determining plot axes.
salkcolorpalette.R : Code that generates Salk approved color palette.
plotsalkcolorpalette.R : Generates a plot of the color palette for manual selection of colors in plots. 


Egg assays:
For egg assays, "_analysis.R" files compute:
		P(off), # of eggs, Mean, Lower quartile, Upper quartile, CV (Coefficient of variation) with associated omnibus and post hoc comparisons.
